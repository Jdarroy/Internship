**What is Jeykll and why do we use it?**

Jekyll uses Markdown - a text-to-HTML conversion
tool – to create a a blog-aware static website that doesn’t require a huge
amount of maintenance. Once you have created the structure you just have to add
your own Markdown file and Jekyll will add it to the website. The appeal of Jeykll for many users is that it allows content editors to
edit the site without knowing how to code. I don’t yet understand how all aspects of the
software works, especially the design aspect – but after some rudimentary
experience I can now create a basic Jeykll website.


**How easy is it to get started with Jeykll?**

This week I built my first website using Jekyll.
I had some initial difficulties understanding how to use it, but once I’d
got the basics I was able to come up with ideas on how to get the best out of
it. Before you can install Jekyll you need to install Ruby and Bundle. I’m on
Windows, so at first it was hard to install Jekyll as it is more suited to
Linux, Linux users are most familiar by using cammand line and it's easier to install Ruby and Bundle on Linux but I found this [website](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/). When I attempted to build a new project with the command “Jeykll new newproject”
I got this:

I was just wondering what you did next at this point to overcome the
problem??


Having got my basic website up and running I wanted
to build a new project within in. However I ran into difficulties almost
immediately. I assumed I had made a mistake earlier on in the process as I did
not appear to have the correct architecture to build my project with. But then
it became clear that there are**two&nbsp;**ways to install
Jekyll. The first is with the instruction “sudo apt-get install jeykll”; and
the second using Ruby is “gem install jeykll”. The difference between these two
instructions is crucial as the first installs an older system of Jeykll and the
second installs the latest version. Most of the help and tuition online is for
the older version of Jekyll and this was what was confusing me but once I
had installed it on a linux and given the command “sudo apt-get install jekyll”
I was able to proceed.

My first attempt at a Jeykll website is now online
and looks like this:

**What's Next?**

I wanted to create a website with different topics, on main page I want to reproduce the main page of the existing [January website](https://www.eclipse.org/january/) and then add a page "Docs" which what you can read all posts about January project. The best aspect of Jekyll is when I will finish the website, could add a post in markdown and add it to the website easily. I recommend to use Jekyll if you want to add post easily and if you don't want to do any HTML, you just have to build the structure and then if you want to add some post you just have to put markdown files in.
