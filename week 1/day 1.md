#Day 1:
##Morning:
Beginning of the internship at 9.30am, presentation of each other.
Then, I had to download the January project and read classes which compose it.
Jonah asked us to read the code and find mistakes.
At the beginning, I understand I must find programming mistakes. I'd spend a long time to try to understand the code but it was hard. It's a very complicated mathematic project and I didn't understand what it does.
I saw Pierre and Yannick found mistakes and did pull request. I'd asked them what they found and it was spelling errors or syntax errors in commentary.
The goal was to make us asked for changing in the code and to show us their way to work.
##Afternoon:
We continued to search mistakes.
I didn't find any mistakes so Jonah asked me to put another example in an example file. I put it in with commentary and i had to meticulously respected the syntax
