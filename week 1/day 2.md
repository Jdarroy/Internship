# Day 2:
Today we had to do different tasks.
Mine consist to create a website dedicated to January project.
I had to create an interface to put the project details like:
	Why use it
	Try it out
	Links for downloads
	Who's involved in the project
I had to take inspiration with another website (https://www.eclipse.org/ice/#intro)
I worked on creation and design the rest of the day; find icons, images, check if there is no licenses.
