# Week 5:

This week I manage to create a website with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) . I had some difficulties to understand why use it. When I finaly understand why use it I began to have ideas how to use it. Jekyll is website generator. You have to install ruby and bundle before to install it. I'm on windows so first it was hard to install it, it's more adapted to linux because you have to install ruby and bundle, on windows when I build a new project with the command "jekyll new newProject" I got this:

But I should obtain this:

Jekyll use markdown file and create a website with it. It create a blog website, and it don't need a huge maintenance. When you have create the structure you just have to add your markdown file and Jekyll add it to the website. So this i work on Jekyll. I don't totaly understand how it work, espacialy for the design but I can do a basic Jekyll website.

# Week 6:

I'm thinking I did a mistake because I don't have the correct architecture when I build a project. In fact, there is a difference because ther is two way to install jekyll. The first one is with the instruction "sudo apt-get install jekyll" and the second using ruby is "gem install jekyll". The difference between theese two instruction is, the first one install on older version of jekyll and the second install the last version. Most of tutorial and help for jekyll on the internet are for the older version, that's why I thought that I did a mistake somewhere and when I installed it on a linux I did the command "sudo apt-get install jekyll" so I obtain the older version.

Now my first version of jekyll's website is online and look like this:
