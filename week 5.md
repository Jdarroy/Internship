# Week 5:

This week I manage to create a website with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) . I had some difficulties to understand why use it. When I finaly understand why use it
I began to have ideas how to use it. Jekyll is website generator. You have to install ruby and bundle before to install it. I'm on windows 
so first it was hard to install it, it's more adapted to linux. Jekyll use markdown file and create a website with it. It create a blog
website, and it don't need a huge maintenance. When you have create the structure you just have to add your markdown file and Jekyll add it
to the website. So this i work on Jekyll. I don't totaly understand how it work, espacialy for the design but I can do a basic Jekyll 
website.
