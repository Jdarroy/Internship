# Internship at Kichwa Coders LTD

Student in second year in IT, I started on April 3, 2017 a 10 weeks internship to validate my training. I was welcomed by the Kichwacoders (High Wycombe, UK) to work on open-source projects. This internship allows to implement the technical skills, mainly in HTML and CSS, and the know-how skills acquired during the training at the university but also to improve significantly the English.

This internship is an opportunity to discover the open-source environment in a small company. The work environment is rather relaxed, no particular dress code required and everyone works with his personal computer.

This internship allowed me to develop my skills in HTML and CSS, as well as in image processing. I was able to learn how to use the bootstrap framework I had already heard about but that I had never used. I then discovered and learned how to use Jekyll to generate static websites. I had difficulties in understanding then in the use of Jekyll, I had problems including versions. This internship also allowed me to improve my English by living and working during these 10 weeks in High Wycombe.

The main reason that pushed me to come was the ability to improve my English. Moreover, I wanted to discover a new working environment and the format of a small company pleased me very much. I was interested in the open source environment but I didnâ€™t know it at all and this internship was an opportunity to discover it.

What particularly pleased me in this course was the atmosphere of work; We were only five in the company and it ensures good communication in the team. Also, every week we went once to the restaurant. I was able to significantly improve my English although we were three French trainees. I was also able to discover the middle of open-source even though my job was to create websites. I was expecting to work in Java on the project January but after seeing the complexity of the project I confess to being surprised and I was afraid of not having the level to work on it. When Tracy explained to us the tasks she wanted to accomplish and that among them there was the development of website, I preferred to propose myself on this task, for which I had less apprehension.

This internship was a very good experience, it allowed me to evolve for 10 weeks in an environment that I did not know at all and more in a foreign country.
